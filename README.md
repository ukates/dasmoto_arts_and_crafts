#Dasmoto's Arts and Crafts

The purpose of this project was to build a simple website
for a fictional arts and crafts store.  The project prompt
provided the images required to make the simple site, and a 
[spec sheet](https://content.codecademy.com/courses/freelance-1/unit-2/dasmotos-arts_redline.jpg) provided by the client.


The only requirements for the project were: 
1. A folder structure that makes sense for the project
2. An html file
3. a css file
